# Todo List Before Actual Merging

- Fix/add missing features, e.g request-streaming.
- Decide on where code should actually live.
- rustfmt(1) code to 80 chars (assuming we want to match C).
- Where should the examples go?
- ... on a related note, what about
  wasmtime/example/wasi\_snapshot\_preview1.reactor.wasm should this live in
  the repository or be acquired from upstream? A similar question could
  perhaps be asked about the wit files.
- Integrate with the build system.
